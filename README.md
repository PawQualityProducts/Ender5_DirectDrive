Creality Ender 5 Plus Direct Drive Mount

Simple Direct Drive Mount for Creality Ender 5 Plus

## You will need
1) <a href="https://github.com/hainesyp/Ender5Plus_DirectDrive/blob/master/DirectDriveMount5.stl">Direct Drive Mount STL file</a><br />
- Build with standard settings with Full Support enabled (there's only a bit of support)   <br />
- I've also included the [FreeCAD Model](https://github.com/hainesyp/Ender5Plus_DirectDrive/blob/master/DirectDriveMount5.FCStd) <br />

## To mount onto the print-head:
1) Remove the Bowden Tube and Connector from the Hot-End  
2) Release the tension on the X Drive  
2) Remove to top two rollers from the Hot-End carriage  
3) Insert the two roller-spacers into the holes on the Direct Drive Mount  
4) Hook the Direct Drive Mount onto the Hot-End carriage, aligning the roller holes  
5) Re-mount the Hot-End carriage, attaching the rollers  
6) Attach the Bowden Tube connector to the Hot-End  
7) Measure and cut 80mm of Bowden Tube. Once fully inserted into the Hot-End and the Extruder assembly, there should be a 10mm(approx) gap between the Hot-End Bowden Tube Connector and Extruder Bowden Connector (see image below)

<i>NB: I recommend heating the Hot-End to ~190+ degress and insert the Bowden Tube into the Hot-End as far as it will go</i>   
<br />
<br />
8) Heat the Hot-End to 190 degrees then Insert the Bowden Tube into the Hot-End as far as it will go.
9) Insert the other end of the Tube into the Extruder Drive Assembly so that the Bowden Tube connects the Hot-End and Extruder Assembly <br />
9) Mount the Extruder Driver Stepper Motor and Extruder Drive Assembly onto the Direct Drive Mount, and complete Extruder Drive Assembly <br />
10) Extend the Extruder drive Stepper Motor cable and connect <br />  
<i>NB: I used <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01EV70C78/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Dupont Wire Male to Female Connector Cables</a> to connect the UEETEK Bipolar Stepper Motor Cable to the existing stepper motor cable so no cutting or soldering was required</i><br />

## Configuration
The Extuder E-Steps were calibrated when I installed the WINSINN Ender Dual Gear Extruder;<br />
However (so far), no other printer, extruder or slicer configuration setting changes have been required
