# DirectDrive Mount for Creality Ender 5+ (5 Pro and 5)
By Paul.Haines@PawQualityProducts.co.uk


## Design Considerations
This is a Simple Direct Drive Mount originally designed for the Creality Ender 5+, but may also be compatible with the Ender 5 and Ender 5 Pro.

It was developed to:
* Improve injection of filament into the Hot-End by mounting the Extruder Drive close to the Hot-End
* Provide a more even balance for the Print-Head by utilising the Extruder Drive Stepper Motor as a counter-weight to Hot-End assembly. This was done by making use of the space between the Print-Head Assembly and Carriage Rollers

## To build the Direct Drive Mount you will need:
1. The Direct Drive Mount STL files<br/>
Two versions are available:
- <a href="https://github.com/hainesyp/Ender5Plus_DirectDrive/blob/master/DirectDriveMount_Ender5_Plus.stl">Ender 5+ version (with BLTouch)</a> 
- <a href="https://github.com/hainesyp/Ender5Plus_DirectDrive/blob/master/DirectDriveMount_Ender5_NoBLTouch.stl">Ender 5x version (without BLTouch)</a> 

A <a href="https://github.com/hainesyp/Ender5Plus_DirectDrive/blob/master/DirectDriveMount_Ender5_x_Guide.stl">Filament Guide</a> is also provided. <i>NB: An M3 (3mm x 20mm) bolt and nut are required to attach the Guide to the Mount</i>
<br />
<i>Build with standard settings with Full Support enabled (there's only a bit of support)</i><br />
<br/>

4. 80mm of Bowden Tube (Capricorn Tubing recommended)

## To mount onto the print-head:

    <td>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>Heat the Hot-End to ~190 degrees then Remove the Bowden Tube from the Hot-End</p>

      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <p>Release the tension on the X Drive belt, then remove to top two rollers from the Hot-End carriage<br/>
        <i>NB: It is recommended that you position the Hot-Bed so that the Print-Head carriage can be supported while the Direct Drive Mount is attached. It's also advisable to protect your Hot-Bed surface during the mounting process (eg. especially when attaching the drive stepper motor)</i>

## Configuration
The Extuder E-Steps were calibrated when I installed the WINSINN Ender Dual Gear Extruder;<br />
However (so far), no other printer, extruder or slicer configuration setting changes have been required
